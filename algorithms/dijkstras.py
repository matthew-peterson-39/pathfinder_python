STUDY NOTES:
    - Initial thoughts: dijkstras algorithm seems to be an inbetween version of the A* and
    a BFS search. I do not fully understand what makes it different than a BFS, other than the
    edges having a cost associated with them, thus allowing a retracing back to the start via the
    shortest possible distance.

    Reqs.
